# 👋 Hi, folks!
I'm Igor Staszak, a DevOps Engineer who also specializes in system administration.

Welcome to my personal GitHub! I have a strong passion for automation, infrastructure as code, and building reliable systems.
From time to time. I anonymize data from my private repositories and share it with you, allowing you to reuse it or gain insight into my work process.

## 📁 What You'll Find Here

This repository is a central hub for:
- My personal projects and infrastructure experiments
- Scripts, templates, and configs I've found useful over the years
- Notes, documentation, and sometimes work-in-progress code

## 🎯 Current Goals

- ~~Preparing for **AWS Cloud Practitioner** exam (scheduled for May 2025)~~ - successfully passed!
- Preparing for **AWS SysOps Administrator** (estimated for Q3 2025)
- Preparing for **Certified Kubernetes Administrator (CKA)** (Q4 2025)
- Expanding my use of **infrastructure as code**
- Refining my homelab and automation toolset

Thanks for stopping by!
