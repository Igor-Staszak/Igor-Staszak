# 👋 Hi, folks!
I'm Igor Staszak - a DevOps Engineer that focuses also on the system adminstration.

Welcome to my personal GitHub! I have a strong passion for automation, infrastructure as code, and building reliable systems.
From time to time. I try to anonymize data from my private repositories and share them with you so can reuse them or get a sneak peek at how I work.

## 📁 What You'll Find Here

This repository is a central hub for:
- My personal projects and infrastructure experiments
- Scripts, templates, and configs I've found useful over the years
- Notes, documentation, and sometimes work-in-progress code

## 🎯 Current Goals

- Preparing for **AWS Cloud Practitioner** exams (scheduled for May 2025) and for **AWS SysOps Administrator** (estimated for June 2025)
- Expanding my use of **infrastructure as code**
- Refining my homelab and automation toolset

Thanks for stopping by!
